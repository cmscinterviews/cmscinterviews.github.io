Hi Everyone,

Tomorrow's class will cover array/strings problems and also many tips to approach them and figure out strategies to solve them. Make sure to bring a notebook and pencil! Tomorrow's class will be led by Phong as Sujith will traveling.

Regarding students on the waitlist for the course, after talking to our advisors and based on the turnout, if you attended class last week you have a spot in the class. Make sure to show up tomorrow as well to sign in to register yourself!

Sincerely,
CMSC Interviews
