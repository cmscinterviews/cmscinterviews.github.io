Hi Everyone,

We are excited to get this class started tomorrow and have some important information for you guys.

The class will take place in Room CSIC 1122 between 2:00pm - 2:50p.m. Make sure to show up on time and bring a notebook to take notes and workout problems. 

Regarding seat availability over a 100 people registered for the class and while we wish we could take all of you, the room only has room for 50 people (fire code restrictions). Due to this issue, we will reserve seats in the class for the first 50 people who signed up and open it up after the first lecture if people don't show. Make sure to come even if you weren't one of the first 50 people as it is likely there will be open spots so you can register. Please email me ASAP if you are unable to make it to tomorrows class but were on the first 50 people list.

Tomorrow's class will go over an overview of the course, resumes, and an introduction to the behavioral portion of the interview. We will post the slides and material on the course website before lecture so that you can follow along in class. Make sure to bring your resume if you want feedback from one of us!

Welcome and we look forward to seeing you tomorrow! Also, hopefully we will be on Piazza by next week so look out for an invite.
