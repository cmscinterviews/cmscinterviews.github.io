Hi Everyone,

Thanks to everyone who showed up and we hope you got a better understanding of resume design and behavioral interviews! Here is a brief overview of everythign covered in class. The presentation is available [here](https://github.com/cmscinterviews/CMSC-Interview-Course-Files/blob/master/Lecture%201%20-%20Intro%20to%20Course%20-%202:3:17.pdf).

Those on the waitlist will be informed if they recieved a spot on Monday.

## Job Hunting
* Great place to find companies to apply to: [intern.supply](http://www.intern.supply/)
* No harm in applying since you won't get blacklisted by applying.

## Resume Design
* Links to templates shown in lecture: 
  * Two Column Resume Template (Tech Style) by Debargha Das: [here](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume)
  * One Column Resume Template (Business Style) by Career Cup: [here](https://www.careercup.com/static_html/Gayle_McDowell_CareerCup_Sample_Resume.doc)
* Helpful resume advice covered in class on Careercup [here](https://www.careercup.com/resume).
* Limit it to one page
* Order content by importance: Experience -> Education -> Everything Else
* Keep it uniform and neat throughout.
* Keep only what matters as recruiters only spend 10 seconds on average per resume.

## Getting an Interview
* Focus on emphasizing work experience and getting internship experience (very important for full-time).
* If you don't have much work experience build side projects in your free time or at hackathons. Large scale projects can substitute for work experience and impress recruiters.
* Experiment with research on the side. Email professors expressing your interest in doing research with them.
* Take project oriented coursework to gain experience.

## Behavioral Interviews
* Interviews that are solely a two-sided conversation between interviewer and you to learn more about each other and the company.
* Generally very relaxing and important to be friendly during the interview as well as show passion for Computer Science.
* More of a cultural fit assessment. Try to learn more about the company and imagine yourself as an employee there.
* S.T.A.R Method is very helpful
  * Situation or Task: Describe the situation you were in or task to be completed. Give enough detail for reader to follow along and visualize scenario. Must be specific event.
  * Action: What action did you take to complete the task or fix the situation? Was it a group effort? Describe the issues and how you resolved each one.
  * Results: What happened after you took those actions? What did you accomplish and what did you learn?
* List of good behavioral interview questions to think about [here](http://recruitloop.com/blog/behavioural-interview-questions/).

## Behavior during Technical Interview
* During the interview:
  * Any clarifying questions
  * Explain components and approach to solution
  * Check if the interviewer is following along
  * Be specific not arrogant
  * Listen to the interviewerâ€™s feedback
* After the interview:
  * Is there anything I can improve in my code?
  * Ask questions specific to the company (future, platform, etc.)
  * Ask questions that make the recruiter think 
    * Genuine: Do you see yourself at XYZ in five years?
    * Interest: Could you tell me more about XYZ and how it works?
    * Insightful: Why did the company choose this programming language?
* Link to Google Mock Interview Video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw).
